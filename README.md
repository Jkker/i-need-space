This repository includes a set of tools to find the nearest vacant NYU classroom at a given time.

Output data can be found in the [`out`](out) folder.



## üó∫Ô∏è NYU Classroom Location Scraper

Scrapes NYU Classroom location data from [nyu.edu](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/registration/classroom-locations.html).

Output is saved to `data/locations.json`

```sh
python locations.py
```

This file also includes a Google Maps API wrapper to find the exact location of each classroom.

The API Key is loaded from the `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable.

To obtain a Google Maps API key, visit [Google Maps Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/start).

## üåü Room Vacancy Calculator

Calculates when each room is available based on the class schedule with the assumption that a room is available if there are no classes scheduled during that time.

```sh
python vacancy-calculator.py [-h] [-t TIME TIME] [-m MIN_DURATION] [-s] [-o OUTPUT] filepath
```

### Options
```text
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TIME TIME, --time-range TIME TIME
                        range of times to search for available times (default: ('08:00', '22:00'))
  -m MIN_DURATION, --min-duration MIN_DURATION
                        minimum duration (minutes) for a time slot to be valid (default: 15)
  -s, --save            save intermediate schedule file (default: False)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output file (default: out/Vacancy-[INPUT_FILE_NAME].json)
```


### Example Usage

```sh
python vacancy-calculator.py --time-range '08:00', '22:00' --min-duration 15 --save --output out/Vacancy-2022fa.json data/2022fa.json
